      "About": "Keanu Reeves is something of an internet legend to the point that some have said he might be immortal. There's even a Snopes page dedicated to dispelling (or enforcing) some of the myths. So when he was snapped by paparazzi miserably snacking on a sandwich on a bench in New York city, Sad Keanu was born. The photograph first became a meme in 2010 when it appeared on Reddit and Green-ovale and from then on lead to Keanu being Photoshopped, sandwich and all, into other photos and settings across the world. The meme got such attention that the BBC even asked Keanu about it in an interview with him in 2011."

      "Year": "2009",
      "About": "A favourite meme for when things get a bit crazy or out of control on the internet, this meme comes from a memorable quote by Will Farrell when he played character Ron Burgundy in 2004's Anchorman. This phrase was heavily quoted across the web on message boards, social networks and in blog comment systems. The Anchorman film has spawned a number of other memes due to its popularity, but this is perhaps the most well-known."

      "Year": "2018",
      "About": "In the early days of 2018, comedian Steven Crowder posted a photo of him sitting at a table with a sign that read - Male privilege is a myth, change my mind. His actions were designed to spark debate outside a Texas University for his Podcast and Youtube channel. The results were interesting. The photo quickly became a template for many memes with people changing the words on the poster, but also Photoshopping someone else behind the desk. The meme also proved incredibly popular on the Subeddit /r/dankmemes."

      "Year": "2008",
      "About": "Success kid (also known as I hate sandcastles) became popular in around 2008 when a photo of a smug baby at the beach was used across the web on social media, mainly as personal profile photographs. Later, the photograph was Photoshopped and turned into thousands of different memes in the animal advice style or referencing his apparent hatred for sandcastles. Success kid goes by the real name Sammy Griner and has now aged a few years, but still seems just as pleased with himself in all the recent photos we've seen. His fame also helped to successfully pay for his father's new kidney after a plea for funding for a transplant went online in the middle of 2016. So maybe he is successful after all!"

      "Year": "2018",
      "About": "In 2012, a post titled Just a book owner's smile… was submitted to Reddit and, shortly after, the glory that is Ermahgerd girl was born. Featuring a young girl, awash with nerdy excitement and brandishing a trio of Goosebumps books, the photo soon became synonymous with oh my God levels of excitement. Some say the misspelling of oh my God as ermahgerd is meant to represent the difficulty that would come speaking with teenage braces. As a result, the text accompanying these memes is often misspelt along the same lines. Ermahgerd spawned many spin-off memes in the form of various excited animals eying up treats and tasty morsels. The girl in the original photograph was eventually found. Maggie Goldenberger was actually just playing dress-up with friends when the snap was taken and found it hilarious many years later when told about the meme."

      "About": "The name Zoë Roth might not ring any bells. But chances are you’ve seen her photo. One Saturday morning in 2005, when Ms. Roth was 4 years old, her family went to look at a house on fire in their neighborhood in Mebane, N.C. Firefighters had intentionally set the blaze as a controlled fire, so it was a relaxed affair: Neighbors gathered and firefighters allowed children to take turns holding the hose. Ms. Roth remembers watching the flames engulf the house when her father, an amateur photographer, asked her to smile. With her hair askew and a knowing look in her eyes, Ms. Roth flashed a devilish smirk as the fire roared behind her. “Disaster Girl” was born."

It wasn't until two years later that the image became a popular meme. With simple captions added to the image to represent real-life things people are distracted by.  This meme continued to prove popular in the months that followed, to the point that near the end of 2018 it was even banned from use in an advert by a recruitment company showing the lure of its offers versus viewers current jobs.

The most common usage of this meme features an image of Patrick Stewart playing Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek with his head in his hands in reaction to events unfolding on the bridge of the Enterprise. There have been many other instances since, including the joy of double facepalms and this wonderful collage."

      "About": "Joseph Ducreux was an 18th Century French artist known for a peculiar style of portrait paintings. In 2009, his particularly quirky self-portrait joined the world of internet memes when superimposed with rap lyrics. The words often featured on these memes include an archaic reinterpretation of the original lyrics with an 18th Century spin. The first recorded version read - Disregard Females, Acquire Currency – a take on Notorious B.I.G’s song Get Money but has since seen many variations."

The original photo of Scumbag Steve features a young man with a baseball cap on sideways standing in a doorway. The photo appeared on Reddit in 2011 and quickly caught on as a popular meme. It often features text portraying Steve as a bad buy who'd happily steal medication from his grandparents or borrow money and never pay people back. The real subject of the photograph is Blake Boston a rapper from the group Beantown Mafia who purports not to be a bad guy after all. Though he's certainly making the most of his internet fame. "

These memes are meant to be delivered with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humour poking fun at how trivial first world problems are."

Kyle also has a claim to fame after being spotted (and recognised) by Seth Rogan when out in public. By all accounts, he's not as down on his luck as the internet would have you believe."

      "About": "The child in the photo wasn't connected to the aid project - Pranav says she met him at a local market and guessed he was about two or three years old. The boy didn't speak English, and Pranav doesn't speak the local languages (which include Luo, Swahili and others), but their brief encounter was captured on camera by another member of the group. Pranav says she hadn't even heard of Reddit before her friend posted it on the message board and it went viral."

      "About": "Overly attached girlfriend is a classic meme that spawned out of a Justin Bieber parody video uploaded by YouTuber Laina in 2012. In that video, she was parodying Bieber's hit song - Boyfriend - where she played a stalker-like girlfriend. The video has since garnered 21 million views and turned into a familiar popular meme. "

      "About": "This is a meme known as Roll Safe or Think about it which is based on a screenshot from 2016's Hood Documentary series on BBC Three which shows a man knowingly pointing at his head while justifying poor decisions. These are essentially daft, but amusing, life hacks where thinking about it can be enough to justify poor life choices. "

A friend of Scanlon's made a bad joke, and Scanlon reacted with his now-famous blink. He’s Blinking Guy, also known as White Guy Blinking, the viral baffled-eyed GIF people use to indicate confusion, and also that they think someone is an ignoramus."
